üßπ Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary
This script performs a systematic data cleaning and variable analysis process on a dataset (df), likely from a real estate or housing domain. Here's a breakdown of the logic and operations step-by-step:
________________________________________
üîç 1. Initial Setup
‚Ä¢	Libraries imported: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn.
‚Ä¢	Pandas display settings adjusted to show all columns and rows for deeper inspection.
________________________________________
üßº 2. Missing Value Analysis
‚Ä¢	Checks and prints the total missing values in each column.
‚Ä¢	A Seaborn heatmap visually highlights missing data across the DataFrame.
‚Ä¢	Calculates the percentage of missing values for each column.
‚Ä¢	Identifies columns with more than 17% null values and drops them.
‚Ä¢	A new heatmap shows the null status after dropping columns.
‚Ä¢	Remaining rows with null values are also dropped, leaving a fully clean DataFrame (df3_drop_rows).
‚Ä¢	Another heatmap confirms there are no missing values left.

üî¢ 3. Numerical Variable Analysis
‚Ä¢	Identifies all numeric columns (int64 and float64).
‚Ä¢	Stores a relevant subset of those in a list num_var.
‚Ä¢	For each variable in num_var, it creates two distribution plots (displot):
o	One from the original DataFrame (df).
o	One from the cleaned DataFrame (df3_drop_rows).
‚Ä¢	This helps compare how distributions of numeric variables changed due to the cleaning process.

üî† 4. Categorical Variable Analysis
‚Ä¢	Extracts all categorical (object-type) columns.
‚Ä¢	Stores relevant ones in the list obj_var.
‚Ä¢	For the MSZoning column, calculates and compares category percentages in the original vs. cleaned dataset.
‚Ä¢	Combines and displays these percentages side-by-side for easy comparison.
________________________________________
üß∞ 5. Function for Categorical Comparison
‚Ä¢	Defines a reusable function cat_var_def(var) that:
o	Returns a side-by-side comparison of category percentage distribution for any categorical variable.
o	Helps identify whether cleaning affected the frequency of each category.
________________________________________
üîÅ 6. Loop Through All Categorical Variables
‚Ä¢	Loops over all variables in obj_var list.
‚Ä¢	For each, the function is called and printed.
‚Ä¢	This gives a detailed printout of category distribution shifts across all key object-type columns in the dataset.
________________________________________
‚úÖ Purpose of the Code
This pipeline:
‚Ä¢	Handles missing data by dropping columns with high null values and removing remaining null rows.
‚Ä¢	Compares distributions of numeric and categorical variables before and after cleaning.
‚Ä¢	Ensures no significant data distortion occurs during preprocessing.
‚Ä¢	Lays a solid foundation for modeling or deeper EDA, especially in structured datasets like housing prices.
